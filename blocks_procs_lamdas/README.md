A chatGPT generated list of exercises to practice Ruby's yield keyword.


## Basic Exercises
1. Create a method that uses `yield` to print "Hello, world!"
2. Modify the previous method to print the string "Hello" twice.
3. Create a method that takes a number as an argument and yields it squared.
4. Create a method that yields with a predefined argument, like "Ruby".

## Intermediate Exercises
1. Write a method that yields each element from an array.
2. Modify the above method to only yield even numbers.
3. Create a method that yields two predefined strings: "hello" and "world".
4. Make a method that expects a block to yield a number, then returns the doubled value.
5. Write a method that takes an argument and uses yield to add 10 to it.
6. Write a method that uses yield to manipulate and print hash keys and values.

## Advanced Exercises
1. Create a method that prints an array of squares of numbers 1 to 5.
2. Create a method with an `if block_given?` check. Test with and without a block.
3. Write a method that accepts an array and a block, sorts the array, and then yields each element.
4. Create a method that simulates basic logging. It should yield a timestamp.
5. Implement a method that yields each vowel in a given string.

## Real-world-like Exercises
1. Create a method to format an array of numbers into currency strings (e.g., $10.00).
2. Write a method that takes a string and yields each word capitalized.
3. Implement a method that accepts an array of transactions and yields each positive transaction.
4. Create a method to generate a list of emails with a specific domain, yielding each email.
5. Write a method to calculate the factorial of a given number using yield.

I hope these exercises help you get a better understanding of how `yield` works in Ruby. Feel free to reach out for solutions or further explanations.
